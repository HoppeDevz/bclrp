# fivem-speedometer (SexySpeedometer)

Good looking speedometer for FiveM, a fork of the original speedometer by [Bluethefurry](https://github.com/Bluethefurry) with awesome improvements. It comes pre-installed with [initialdspeedo](https://github.com/Bluethefurry/initialdspeedo-fivem) (extra skins). The speed unit used is automatically selected depending on your settings.
